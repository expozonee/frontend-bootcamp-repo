.outer {
  width: 100px;

}

.inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightgreen;
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
}

/* explain: 
    
since the inner div is positioned absolute it is positioned relative to the first parent element that has a position that is not static
since the outer div has no position set, the inner div is positioned relative to the body element
if we need to position the inner div relative to the outer div we need to set the outer div position to relative

*/

/* correct code */

.outer {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: darkcyan;
  margin: 50px;
  position: relative;
}
